# Scalable-Backtesting-Infrastructure
# Business need
A startup called Mela wants to make it simple for everyone to enter the world of
cryptocurrencies. It also wants to give investors a reliable source of investment while
lowering the risk associated with trading cryptocurrencies. This project is designing and
building a reliable, large-scale trading data pipeline.
# Backtesting
Backtesting is the process of evaluating the performance of a trading strategy or an
investment model by applying it to historical market data. It involves simulating the
application of a trading strategy or an investment approach using past data to see how it
would have performed during that time period.
# Methodology
## Setup and Installation:
    Install Backtrader: pip install backtrader
    Install additional dependencies like pandas, matplotlib, etc.
## Data Preparation:
    Collect historical data (CSV, pandas DataFrame, or other supported formats)
    Ensure data includes OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) information
## Define Strategy:
    Create a class that inherits from backtrader.Strategy
    Implement __init__, next, and optionally start, stop methods
    Define indicators, entry/exit rules, and position sizing
## Set up the Cerebro engine:
    Create a Cerebro instance
    Add data feeds
    Add the strategy
    Set starting cash
    Add analyzers and observers
## Run the backtest:
    Call cerebro.run()
## Analyze results:
    Examine performance metrics
    Visualize results using cerebro.plot()
